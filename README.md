# ðŸŽ® 2048 game

## Description
2048 is a simple yet addictive puzzle game where the goal is to combine tiles with the same numbers to create a tile with the number 2048. Players move the tiles by using the arrow keys in four directionsâ€”up, down, left, or rightâ€”and each move merges tiles of the same value while new tiles appear on the grid. The game challenges players to think strategically to achieve higher numbers without filling the grid, as the game ends when no more moves are possible.
